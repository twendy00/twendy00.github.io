# Hi! I'm Wendy ðŸ˜Š

I'm an Associate Data Engineer and a student at Launch School. I'm language agnostic, but I primarily work in Python, SQL, and Ruby. 

## Background
In a prior life, I worked in data analytics and eventually decided to become a developer. Why? The deeper I worked in analytics and data science, the more I realized I enjoy building tools rather than discovering and delivering insights. I'm particularly interested in how to build maintainable and resilient applications, technologies that benefit communities and social justice causes, and engaging and intuitive user interface designs. 

## On a Personal Level
I currently live in Utah but would like to move and settle in the Pacific Northwest in the near future. I have a strong love for nature and animals. In my free time, I like to read, be in the outdoors, and experiment in the kitchen.
